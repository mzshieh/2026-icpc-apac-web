We recommend that participants stay at the [CP Hotel](https://www.cphotel.com.tw/index.aspx?lang=US), which offers a special rate for contest participants. Please follow the [instructions](/assets/championship/2026/CP_HOTEL_BOOKING_2026.pdf) to make your reservation. Staying at the recommended hotel is not mandatory, and teams are free to arrange their own accommodation. However, for convenience during the contest period, we strongly suggest choosing a hotel near a Taoyuan Metro station close to the contest venue, which is located very near Station A19 (Taoyuan Sports Park).
